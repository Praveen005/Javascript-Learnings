/*

DOM is a structured representation of the webpage's content and provides a way for programs and scripts to interact with web pages.

The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.


Key points about the DOM:

    Structured Representation: The DOM represents the web page as a tree-like structure, where each element (such as HTML tags) and attribute (like the text within elements) of the page is represented as a node in the tree.

    Platform and Language-Neutral: The DOM is not tied to any specific programming language or platform. It can be accessed and manipulated using various programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.


    HTML and XML Documents: The DOM can be used with both HTML and XML[Xml (eXtensible Markup Language) is a mark up language. XML is designed to store and transport data] documents. 

    Event Handling: The DOM enables event-driven programming, allowing scripts to respond to user interactions (like clicks and keystrokes) and other events (such as page load or form submission).

    Cross-Browser Compatibility

    Document Manipulation: The DOM allows you to create, modify, and delete elements and content within a web page. 


Must see a DOM tree how it looks, maybe asked in an interview.
